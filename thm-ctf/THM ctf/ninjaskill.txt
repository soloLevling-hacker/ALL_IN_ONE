Question 1 — Which of the above files are owned by the best-group group(enter the answer separated by spaces in alphabetical order)

CMD:-find / -group best-group 2>/dev/null
USE:-
The command searches for files or directories in the entire file system with the group best-group, and hides error messages from the user.

find /: Searches from the root directory (/) of the file system. This means the search will be performed across all directories and files in the system.

-group best-group: Searches for files or directories whose group is best-group. If there are files or directories owned by this group, they will be found and displayed.

2>/dev/null: Redirects error messages to /dev/null, so they do not appear in the output. This is useful when you want to ignore error messages, such as insufficient permissions to access certain files or directories.

Question 2 — Which of these files contain an IP address?

CMD:-find / -type f \( -name 8V2L -o -name bny0 -o -name c4ZX -o -name D8B3 -o -name FHl1 -o -name oiMO -o -name PFbD -o -name rmfX -o -name SRSq -o -name uqyw -o -name v2Vb -o -name X1Uy \) -exec grep -E -o '(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)' * {} \; 2>/dev/null

USE:-
The command searches for files with specific names in the root of the file system and performs an IP address search within each found file, while ignoring error messages.

find /: Starts searching from the root directory (/) of the file system, meaning it will search through all directories and files in the system.

-type f: Limits the search to files only (not directories).

-exec: This command executes a command on every file found.

grep -E -o ‘(25[0–5]|2[0–4][0–9]|[01]?[0–9][0–9]?).(25[0–5]|2[0–4][0–9]|[01]?[0–9][0–9]?).(25[0–5]|2[0–4][0–9]|[01]?[0–9][0–9]?).(25[0–5]|2[0–4][0–9]|[01]?[0–9][0–9]?)’:

grep -E: Uses the extended version of grep, allowing the use of extended regular expressions.
-o: Prints only the match itself, not the entire line. The regular expression searches for IP addresses in IPv4 format, identifying four groups of numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots.

{} ;: Marks the end of the command to be executed on each found file. {} represents the found file.

2>/dev/null: Redirects error messages to /dev/null, so they do not appear in the output. This is useful when you want to ignore error messages, such as when you don't have permission to access certain files.


Question 3 — Which file has the SHA1 hash of 9d54da7584015647ba052173b84d45e8007eba94

CMD:-find / -type f \( -name 8V2L -o -name bny0 -o -name c4ZX -o -name D8B3 -o -name FHl1 -o -name oiMO -o -name PFbD -o -name rmfX -o -name SRSq -o -name uqyw -o -name v2Vb -o -name X1Uy \) -exec sha1sum {} \; 2>/dev/null

USE:- The command searches for specific files by name throughout the entire file system, calculates the SHA-1 hash for each of them, and hides any error messages.

find /: Searches in the root directory (/) of the file system. This means it will search throughout the entire file system, including subdirectories.

-type f: Specifies that the search is limited to files only.

-exec sha1sum {} ;:

    -exec: Indicates that the following command will be executed on every file found.
    sha1sum: Calculates the SHA-1 hash for the file.
    {}: Represents each file found by the find command.
    ;: Marks the end of the command to be executed on the files.

2>/dev/null: Redirects error messages to /dev/null, so they are not displayed. This is useful to hide error messages caused by insufficient permissions to access certain files.


Question 4 — Which file contains 230 lines?

CMD;-find / -type f \( -name 8V2L -o -name bny0 -o -name c4ZX -o -name D8B3 -o -name FHl1 -o -name oiMO -o -name PFbD -o -name rmfX -o -name SRSq -o -name uqyw -o -name v2Vb -o -name X1Uy \) -exec wc -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

USE:-
The command searches for files by specific names in the file system and counts the lines in each file found using the wc -l command. Error messages are hidden from the user.

find /: Searches from the root directory (/) of the file system, meaning the search will be conducted through all directories and files in the system.

-type f: Limits the search to files only

exec: Indicates that the following command will be executed on each file found.

wc -l: The wc command counts words and characters, and with the -l flag, it counts the number of lines in the file.

{}: Represents each file found during the search.

;: Marks the end of the command to be executed on each file found.

2>/dev/null: Redirects error messages to /dev/null so that they don’t appear in the output. This is useful for hiding error messages, for example, when there are insufficient permissions to access certain files.

Everything we got in the list are files that do not match our needs. So, we are left with only one file.


Question 5 — Which file’s owner has an ID of 502?

CMD:-find / -type f \( -name 8V2L -o -name bny0 -o -name c4ZX -o -name D8B3 -o -name FHl1 -o -name oiMO -o -name PFbD -o -name rmfX -o -name SRSq -o -name uqyw -o -name v2Vb -o -name X1Uy \) -exec ls -ln {} \; 2>/dev/null

USE:-
The command searches for files with specific names and displays detailed information about them while ignoring error messages.

find /: Starts a search from the root directory (/) of the filesystem. This means the search will be conducted in all directories and files in the system.

-type f: Limits the search to files only (not directories).

-exec: Indicates that the following command will be executed on each found file.

ls -ln: The ls command with flags that display detailed information about the files.

{}: Represents the name of each file found.

;: Marks the end of the command to be executed on each found file.

2>/dev/null: Redirects error messages to /dev/null, so they will not be displayed in the output. This is useful for hiding error messages, such as when there are insufficient permissions to access certain files.


Question 6 — Which file is executable by everyone?

CMD:-find / -type f \( -name 8V2L -o -name bny0 -o -name c4ZX -o -name D8B3 -o -name FHl1 -o -name oiMO -o -name PFbD -o -name rmfX -o -name SRSq -o -name uqyw -o -name v2Vb -o -name X1Uy \) -exec ls -ln {} \; 2>/dev/null
