NOTE:- 

CMD:-gpg2john fgd.asc > dfhsdg

This command is used to extract a hash from a PGP/GPG private key file (fgd.asc) so that it can be cracked using John the Ripper.
🔍 Explanation:

    gpg2john: A tool provided by John the Ripper that converts GPG private key files (usually .asc or .gpg) into crackable hash formats.

    fgd.asc: The exported GPG private key in ASCII-armored format.

    > dfhsdg: Saves the hash output into the file dfhsdg.
    
 
CMD :-ssh2john fgd.asc > dfhsdg

is using the ssh2john utility from the John the Ripper suite. Here's what it does:
Breakdown:

    ssh2john: A tool that converts SSH private key files into a format that John the Ripper can understand and try to crack.

    fgd.asc: This is your input file — an SSH private key (in this case, an ASCII-armored .asc file).

    > dfhsdg: Redirects the output to a file called dfhsdg.   
    
    
gpg:-

gpg (GNU Privacy Guard) is a tool used for encryption, decryption, and digital signatures. It implements the OpenPGP standard and is commonly used to:

    Encrypt files or messages securely.
    Verify authenticity via signatures.
    Share public keys for secure communication.

🔑 Common Commands

🔐 Encrypt a file
gpg -e -r recipient@example.com file.txt

Encrypts file.txt for the recipient (must have their public key).

🔓 Decrypt a file
gpg -d file.txt.gpg

Decrypts an encrypted file (must have the private key).

✍️ Sign a file
gpg --clearsign file.txt

Creates a signed version of the file to prove authorship.

🔍 Verify a signature
gpg --verify file.txt.asc

🗝️ Generate a new key pair
gpg --full-generate-key

Follow the prompts (name, email, encryption strength).

📥 Import a public key
gpg --import publickey.asc

📤 Export your public key
gpg --export -a yourname@example.com > mykey.asc

💡 Useful Notes

    GPG uses asymmetric encryption (public/private key pair).
    You can also use symmetric encryption with -c:

gpg -c file.txt
This asks for a passphrase instead of using a key.

STEP 1:-

scanning the target we got 2 ports open 21 ftp and 22 ssh

so we try to open ftp using username=anonymous password=[...] thats work 
ftp [ip]
here we download some file like user.txt and backup.pgp,etc...

STEP 2:-

CMD:-ls
'Additional Tools'   backup.pgp   mozo-made-15.desktop   NetworkConfigs   private.asc   Tools user.txt

THAN we open private.asc file and show the private.asc have ssh rsa key 

STEP 3:-

so i need to crack passphrase using john
 
root@ip-10-10-190-137:~/Desktop# john private.asc --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
No password hashes loaded (see FAQ)

here file encrypt in utf-8, so we convert key to decrytable hash file using ssh2john

root@ip-10-10-190-137:~/Desktop# ssh2john private.asc > kkk
ssh2john: command not found

here  ssh2john is not working so we try gpg2john

root@ip-10-10-190-137:~/Desktop# gpg2john private.asc > kkk
File private.asc

here we get file than using john we crack the passphrase

root@ip-10-10-190-137:~/Desktop# john kkk --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 

here we got xbox360 passphrase for over encryptrd file.

STEP 4:-
                          
HERE USING passphrase we access file

here we find credential of root so we need to decrept hash and get password.

STEP 5:-

first we crete file using nano than paste hash into file.


root@ip-10-10-190-137:~/Desktop# nano mmm
root@ip-10-10-190-137:~/Desktop# cat mmm

here we make file than we need to crack the hash using john

here we succesfully completed over work and we got root password 
username=root

than we using this credential open the sssh server.
