zip2john is a tool from the John the Ripper (JtR) suite used to extract password hashes from ZIP archives. These hashes can then be cracked using john.

ðŸ“‚ Step-by-Step Example

    Get the hash from a ZIP file:

zip2john myarchive.zip > zip_hash.txt

Start cracking with John:

john zip_hash.txt

Check cracked password(s):

john --show zip_hash.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

step 1:- first scan the terget using nmap
CMD:-nmap -sV -p ip
ftp
ssh
http
we show the open ports and server and running services and version.

step 2:- than we go to browser and open ip(web). show the web tell the use your name as codename on user agent
but we have not any name so we using burp to capture request and  delete all info in user-agent and type R. this R give from website like agent R. so we try and show the this will work
response:-why ary you use 1 of 25 employe name. here we show the componey have 26 employ with R, so we know all employe id is A-Z.
 so we try A,B,C here C so the password is weak and send to J also show mus to his username.
 
step 3:- after we know the username using hydra bruteforse on ftp and login

CMD:-hydra -l [username] -P [path of password file]  -u [ftp://ip]

 here we find password of over username.
 
step 4:- than login with those credential on ftp server and get some file and images.
 
 CMD:-cat [image name]
 
 we show the To_agentR.txt=........
 so we using binwalk end extract image hidden data to in file
 
CMD:-binwalk -e [image name] 

Than go to this folder but here is one problem. the zip file is not extracting becuse the zip is uses password hashing encryption.
 
step 5:- here we uses zip2john this will etract all password hashes in file

CMD:-zip2john [zip name] > [file name you want extract ex:-name.txt]

after that we show the name.txt file made and inside the file is zip password hash.
so, using john we crack the hash

CMD:- john name.txt

this will give the password of zip file

step 6:- after that we uses 7z on zip file

CMD:-7z e [zip name]

here this need to pass that we extract before using john
than we open file To_agentR.txt and show the inside the file is password.

than we uses on steganography on another image file this will give the username. above password is the this username.

tool:-
exiftool
binwalk
steghide


step 7:- than we goto ssh server and enter this credential and enter ssh server shell

than we escalation priviliges user to root

CMD:-sudo -l 

than will give output we need just copy and past on google and find related bugs mean CVE.
than we uses this CVE and become root
