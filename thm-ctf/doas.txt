The doas.conf file is the configuration file for the doas command, which is a minimal and secure alternative to sudo, originally developed for OpenBSD but also available on Linux.
📄 Location

Usually found at:

/etc/doas.conf

🔧 Basic Syntax

Each rule typically follows this format:

permit [options] [user] [as target_user] [cmd [args]]

✅ Common Examples
1. Allow a user to run all commands as root

permit khush

2. Allow a user to run a specific command as root

permit khush as root cmd /sbin/poweroff

3. Allow a user to run any command as any user

permit khush as any

4. Allow a user to run commands without a password

permit nopass khush


✅ Example Minimal File

# Allow khush to run anything as root without password
permit nopass khush

🔁 Apply Changes

No service restart is needed after editing doas.conf. Just save the file and doas will use it next time you run a command.
